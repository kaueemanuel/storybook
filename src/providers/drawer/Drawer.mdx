# Drawer

## Usage

<p>
  React Drawer was used to create the drawer, so all options are found here{" "}
  <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/api/drawer/" target="_blank">
    React Drawer Api Reference
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  To make use of the drawer you must use the `DrawerProvider`, to do this import
  it into the scope of your application with children inside. By default, this
  has already been done globally.
</p>

```tsx
import { DrawerProvider } from "pgv-lib/ui/drawer"
;<React.StrictMode>
  <DrawerProvider>
    <App />
  </DrawerProvider>
</React.StrictMode>
```

<p>
  Now just imports from hook `useDrawer` the `openDrawer` function anywhere in
  the application and to use.{" "}
  <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/api/drawer/" target="_blank">
    drawerProps options
  </a>
  .
</p>

```tsx
import { useDrawer } from "pgv-lib/ui/hooks/drawer"

const { openDrawer } = useDrawer()

openDrawer({
  headerProps: {
    title: "Title",
    description: "Description",
    breadcrumb: "Home / Function",
  },
  HeaderComponent: DrawerHeader,
  ActionsComponent: DrawerActions,
  drawerContent: <DrawerContent key="content">Content</DrawerContent>,
  drawerProps: {
    noCloseButtonHeader: true,
    showButtonAnchor: true,
    showButtonFullscreen: true,
    noTopButtonAnchor: true,
    noRightButtonAnchor: true,
    noBottomButtonAnchor: true,
    noLeftButtonAnchor: true,
  },
})
```

<p>If you want to close the drawer you can use the `closeDrawer` function.</p>

```tsx
import { useDrawer } from "pgv-lib/ui/hooks/drawer"

const { openDrawer, closeDrawer } = useDrawer()

openDrawer({
  drawerContent: "Content",
})

// dismiss open drawer
closeDrawer()
```
